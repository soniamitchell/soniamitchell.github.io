      <description>A comprehensive index of R packages and documentation from CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub and R-Forge.
 rdrr.io is a very interesting website to play around with. Not only an exhaustive index of R packages and documentation, it is capable of running R directly from your browser or within an R Notebook. The implementation comes preloaded with over 12,000 packages, which is very impressive indeed.
If you want to embed interactive R code in your Hugo website&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Live Share extension provides a great way to collaborate on code whilst working from home. Assuming read/write access is enabled, you and your team mates can edit code, highlight sections of it, save it, and run it in real-time.
Just bear in mind that when code is run, it is run locally, which means you won&amp;rsquo;t have access to any objects that aren&amp;rsquo;t in your own environment or datasets that aren&amp;rsquo;t on your own machine.</description>

      <description>Step 1 - Creating your website locally We&amp;rsquo;re going to do this on a Mac. Things might be a bit different if you&amp;rsquo;re using Windows, so be aware of that.
First you need to install hugo. You can do this in the terminal:
brew install hugo Now decide where you want your website to be created. I like to keep all my work in a Desktop folder called git. Go to this directory.</description>
